# Safety Issues Involving Breathing-Circuit Filters

Patients suffering from SARS sometimes require mechanical ventilation. This raises safety concerns about the SARS virus being carried by droplets that exit from the exhalation limb of the ventilator. ECRI recommends that breathing-circuit filters be incorporated in the exhalation limb of any ventilator used on a patient with SARS. In this article, we review the issues behind our recommendations and describe steps hospitals can take to prevent any adverse effects on ventilation.

For guidance on protective measures to take during maintenance of medical devices that have been exposed to the SARS virus, refer to the Guidance Article [Protecting against Infectious Disease Transmission during Equipment Maintenance: Lessons from the 2003 SARS Outbreak.](https://www.ecri.org/components/HDJournal/Pages/Equipment-Maintenance-Lessons-from-2003-SARS-Outbreak.aspx?tab=1)

## SARS Patients on Mechanical Ventilation

Patients with SARS who have difficulty breathing or maintaining adequate blood oxygen levels may need to be placed on mechanical ventilation. Ventilating a SARS patient raises infection control concerns, however, since the SARS virus may exit the ventilator in droplet or aerosol form along with the patient's exhaled air. Although this has not been demonstrated as a known mechanism for spreading SARS, we believe that taking steps to minimize such a risk would be prudent.

Hospitals should prepare now for the possibility of ventilating SARS patients by reviewing their infection control policies and practices related to ventilator use and ensuring that appropriate practices are consistently followed. In particular, some new practices may be required related to the use of breathing-circuit filters.[1] 

CDC has issued several statements about using filters on the exhalation limb of ventilator circuits. For example, it states that "Some hospitals caring for SARS patients have used bacterial/viral filters on exhalation valves of mechanical ventilators to prevent contaminated aerosols from entering the environment. Although the effectiveness of this measure in reducing the risk of SARS transmission is unknown, the use of such filters may be prudent during HFOV [high-frequency oscillatory ventilation] of patients with SARS" (CDC 2003 May 20). And in its guidelines on ventilator use during air and ground transport of SARS patients, CDC calls for "HEPA [high-efficiency particulate-air] or equivalent filtration of airflow exhaust" (CDC 2003 May 8 and 2003 Apr 29).

ECRI recommends the use of breathing-circuit filters on the exhalation limb whenever SARS patients are mechanically ventilated. This is a prudent measure that might help reduce the risk of spreading the disease. Using filters also eliminates the need for cleaning and sterilizing or disinfecting any reusable components downstream of the filter.

Many hospitals already routinely use filters in the breathing-circuit exhalation limb for all ventilator patients. These hospitals will need to verify that the filters they are using provide adequate protection against the spread of SARS. Some ventilators require the use of a specific filter; if this filter does not offer enough protection, then an additional one will have to be installed upstream of the existing filter and the exhalation valve.

Hospitals not already using filters will need to decide if this is to be done for all patients or only for patients who have, or might have, SARS (or other diseases caused by airborne infectious agents, such as tuberculosis). These hospitals will also need to ensure that an effective filter is selected and that it is used in a way that provides protection and does not interfere with patient ventilation. They should consult with the ventilator equipment manufacturer as needed.

## Filter Selection and Placement

Breathing-circuit filters are available from a number of suppliers. CDC calls for the use of a HEPA filter in some of its recommendations. As an alternative, breathing circuit filters having bacterial and viral filtration efficiencies of 99.97% or greater will offer protection equal to or better than HEPA filters. Before a final selection is made, the fit of the filter into the circuit should be checked to verify that the filter does not increase the risk of a breathing circuit disconnection, misconnection, or obstruction.

When possible, the filter should be placed upstream of any reusable components. For an intensive care ventilator, the filter should usually be attached between the end of the exhalation limb tubing and the ventilator so that it will prevent contamination of the exhalation valve and other reusable components located at or within the ventilator.

[1] Hospitals should also review their policies for protecting healthcare workers during potential aerosol-generating procedures. CDC recommends such a review because of the possibility that procedures capable of stimulating coughs and prompting the generation of aerosols could increase the risk of SARS transmission. Aerosol-generating procedures include administration of aerosolized medication treatment; diagnostic sputum induction; bronchoscopy; airway suctioning; endotracheal intubation; positive-pressure ventilation via facemask (e.g., BiPAP, CPAP), during which air may be forced out around the facemask; and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV).
