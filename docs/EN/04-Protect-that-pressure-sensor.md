## Protect That Pressure Sensor

Many ventilators have a sensor located inside the ventilator, with a tube or pathway allowing the pressure in the breathing circuit to be sampled. Since the sensor cannot be accessed for cleaning and disinfection, it must be protected against contamination. In many cases, a breathing-circuit filter positioned at the connection between the exhalation tubing and the ventilator will prevent sensor contamination. However, if a breathing-circuit pressure-sensor line is connected to the patient wye, make sure that a HEPA filter (or better) is used in the sensor-line tubing between the wye and the ventilator. Verify that moisture will not create back pressure or occlusion that will interfere with pressure sensing.
