## Background & Need

In 2003, more than 8,000 people worldwide contracted SARS—a respiratory illness that usually begins with a fever, progresses to include other symptoms, and can lead to the development of pneumonia. During the initial outbreak, 774 deaths were attributed to the disease. In less than two months at the start of 2020, the impact of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that causes COVID-19 has far surpassed those totals. COVID-19 is spreading faster than SARS did, and has already infected tens of thousands of patients. COVID-19 appears to progress with relatively mild symptoms at first, then develops to pneumonia and potentially to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is hard to treat and often requires the patient to be put on a ventilator (advanced life support).
The mechanism of SARS-CoV transmission was understood to be associated with close contact with a SARS-infected person or exposure to large-droplet secretions from an infected person's cough or sneeze. As reported in The Lancet[**DOWNLOAD**](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930374-3/fulltext) (subscription or fee required for access) in mid-February 2020, "presently COVID-19 seems to spread from person to person by the same mechanism as other common cold or influenza viruses—ie, face to face contact with a sneeze or cough, or from contact with secretions of people who are infected."
In the case of SARS, transmission of the disease was quickly controlled, and the outbreak was declared over by July 2003. Nevertheless, concern existed that SARS could in fact be a seasonal disease and that another outbreak could occur in later years. The threat of another outbreak underscored the importance of facilities having a response plan in place to safeguard the health of their communities and staff members. ECRI Institute produced a series of articles in 2003 and 2004 discussing the risks associated with SARS, reviewing recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), discussing the role of hospital facilities staff and clinical engineers in SARS preparations, and updating ECRI's recommendations for infection control procedures during equipment servicing.
