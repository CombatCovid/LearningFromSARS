# Preventing Adverse Effects on Ventilation

Any new component in a ventilator breathing circuit can introduce new risks. With filters, the greatest risk is that moisture accumulating in the filter could cause increased exhalation resistance or an obstruction, possibly resulting in decreased ventilation effectiveness or pneumothorax. Misconnection or disconnection of breathing-circuit components may also be possible.

Be sure that policies on using breathing-circuit filters are available and that appropriate training is provided for respiratory therapy, nursing, and any other personnel responsible for setting up and using the ventilator. Policies and training should include the following instructions:

 - Follow the manufacturer's instructions on the maximum filter replacement interval (often 24 hours). Consider tagging the filter with the date and time that it is installed in the breathing circuit; be sure to make clear that this is the installed date, not the replace-by date.
 - Make sure that the filter is correctly and securely installed so that it does not contribute to any risk of disconnection of any portion of the breathing circuit or misconnection of components.
 - Install the filter before performing manual pre-use checks and automatic ventilator breathing-circuit compliance tests.
 - Follow manufacturer recommendations and hospital policies for emptying water traps so as to minimize infection risks while ensuring that the trap does not overfill into the filter.
 - Use care in handling and disposing of the contaminated filter.
 - During ventilation, watch for signs of obstruction or increased exhalation resistance. One way to do this is to monitor the peak expiratory flow and the duration and slope of the exhaled breath on the waveform display. Alternatively, if no waveform display is available, exhalation pressure can be checked during an expiratory hold maneuver.
 - Consider the use of a heated-wire circuit or a heat/moisture exchanger (HME), if appropriate, to minimize the moisture in the breathing circuit and therefore the moisture load on the filter.

Update the ventilator worksheet as needed. Alternatively, at least record filter replacements and the checks that have been made for high resistance.

It is important to decide on policies now, obtain appropriate filters, and be sure that staff are familiar with their correct use. Waiting until there is actually a SARS patient who requires ventilation may not leave you enough time to implement the required measures. This could unnecessarily increase personnel exposure to the virus or place the patient at risk from incorrect filter application and maintenance.
